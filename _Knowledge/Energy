Conservative Force
When the work done by a force is independent of the path, then this force is called a conservative force.
Ex) the weight of the particle and elastic force of the spring.

Potential Energy
It is the measure of the amount of work a consercative force will do when it moves from a position to the datum (reference plane).
If energy comes from the motion of the particle, it is referred to as kinetic energy.
