Conservative Force
When the work done by a force is independent of the path, then this force is called a conservative force.
Ex) the weight of the particle and elastic force of the spring.

Potential Energy
It is the measure of the amount of work a consercative force will do when it moves from a position to the datum (reference plane).
If energy comes from the motion of the particle, it is referred to as kinetic energy.

For a particle: initial = final

The conservation of mechanical energy or simply the conservation of energy, during the motion the sum of the kinetic and potential energies remains constant.

For a system of particles:
If a system of particles is subjected only to conservative forces, the sum of initial kinetic and potential energy is equal to the final kinetic and potential energy.
