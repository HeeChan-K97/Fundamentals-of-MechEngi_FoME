Friction
: A force that resists the movement of two contacting surfaces that slide relative to one another
: Acts tangent to the surfaces at points of contact with other body
: Oppose the possible existing motion of the body relative to points of contact
: Tow types of friction can occur between surfaces (with or without lubrication) - Fluid and Coulomb Friction
: Fluid friction exist when the contacting surface are separated by a film of fluid
: Depends on the velocity of the fluid and its ability to resist shear force
: Coulomb friction occurs between the contacting surfaces of bodies in the absence of a lubricating fluid
