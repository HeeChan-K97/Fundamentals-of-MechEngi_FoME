Beam: Not a two force member, slender member(support loadings that are perpendicular to longitudinal axis)
Shear: When the external loads tend to cause the two segments to slide over each other
Tortional: Tend to twist one segment of the body with respect to the other

In Shear force, if shear force cause an object to rotate in Clockwise(CW), it is considered to be in positive direction of the motion, and Counter-clockwise is negative direction

Types of Beam
1. Simply supported beam
2. Cantilevered beam
3. Overhanging beam
